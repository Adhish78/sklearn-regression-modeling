## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset (`Steel_industry_data.csv`) is placed in the project directory.

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook.

3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load, preprocess, analyze, and model the data.

## Analysis and Models

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: Load and inspect the dataset for initial understanding.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Convert date columns, handle missing values, and transform categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Univariate Analysis: Distribution of continuous variables.
    - Bivariate Analysis: Relationship between continuous variables and Load type.
    - Time Series Analysis: Trends over time.
    - Correlation Analysis: Heatmap of the correlation matrix.
    - Energy usage analysis by WeekStatus and Day of week.
4. **Statistical Analysis**:
    - Hypothesis testing on energy consumption between weekdays and weekends.
    - Regression analysis to determine the impact of CO2 levels on energy consumption.
5. **Regression Modeling**: Build and evaluate multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR.

## Results

The evaluation metrics for each regression model are calculated and compared. Metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score. Plots of actual vs. predicted values and residuals are provided for visual analysis.
